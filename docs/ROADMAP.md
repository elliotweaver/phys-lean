# THE ROADMAP — the nodes, as TARGETS only
*Each node states WHAT must be achieved, its dependency, and its drift trap. It does NOT state
HOW to prove it — the derivation is the worker's job (that is the whole point; a hardcoded
solution trains nothing). Read docs/STANDARD.md and docs/RUNBOOK.md first. Nodes are executed
in dependency order — a node may not start until its prerequisites are `done`.*

---

## The shape of the chain
The chain begins at the **fold** and unfolds by forced steps. Early nodes are pure structure
(no physics words needed at all). Physics *names* appear only once the derived structure is
rich enough that a physicist recognizes it — and even then the name is removable (STANDARD §2).

Depth layers (mirrored in the `Phys/` folder structure):
- **Foundation** (depth 0) — the fold and what it immediately forces.
- **Cascade** (depth 1) — the forced algebra sequence and its termination.
- **Algebra** (depth 2) — the structures the terminal algebra forces.
- **Emergent** (depth 3+) — the structures physics recognizes, each a theorem.

---

## N1 — THE FOLD  (Foundation, depth 0, the root)
**Target.** Formalize the fold — self-look-back — as a mathematical object, and prove the
first property it forces. The fold is the project's ONE permitted posit (STANDARD §3): it is
*defined*, not derived from anything prior. Everything after N1 must be *derived*, never
posited.
**What "done" requires.** A Lean definition of the fold/self-reference operator and a proved
theorem capturing its defining consequence (the self-blindness / fixed-point property that the
trunk rests on). Foundations-only, costume that a WRONG version fails, gate green, STANDARD met.
**Dependency.** None (it is the root).
**Drift trap.** Do NOT import any physics. Do NOT posit ℂ/ℍ/𝕆 or J²=−1 as given — N1 defines
the fold and proves its immediate forced property; the algebra cascade is N2's job to DERIVE.
Do NOT smuggle a target structure in by choosing a definition that "happens to" be the answer;
the definition must be the honest formalization of self-look-back, and the property must follow.
**Physics-words-removable.** N1 should contain essentially NO physics words — it is pure
structure. If it needs a physics word to state its theorem, that is a red flag.

## N2 — THE CASCADE AND ITS STOP  (Cascade, depth 1)
**Target.** Derive — not posit — the forced sequence of structures that the fold generates,
and prove it TERMINATES at a specific point (the cascade does not continue forever; something
forces it to stop). This is the crown node: the field at large *posits* its starting algebra;
here it must be *derived* from N1, with the stopping point *proved*.
**What "done" requires.** Each step of the cascade is a theorem (structure k forces structure
k+1), and a theorem that the cascade halts at the terminal structure (the step that would
continue is proved impossible / loses a required property). Foundations-only, costumes that a
wrong continuation and a wrong stop both fail, gate green, STANDARD met.
**Dependency.** N1.
**Drift trap.** Do NOT assume the terminal algebra and check properties backward — DERIVE the
sequence forward from N1 and let the stop be FORCED. Do NOT hardcode the number of steps. The
stop must be a proved impossibility, not an asserted halt. If any step "fights you," return to
the fold (THE ONE LAW) — do not add a hypothesis to force the next rung.
**Physics-words-removable.** Still essentially pure structure. No physics names should be load-
bearing.

## ⚠ STANDING DEPENDENCY GATE — THE BASE FIELD (the continuum)  (Foundation, cross-cutting)
**This is not a sequential node; it is a precondition attached to the entire Emergent layer.**

**The issue.** The cascade (N2) is purely algebraic: Cayley–Dickson *takes a base ring as
input and doubles it*. The base it doubles is currently a stand-in (ℚ for concrete witnesses;
some real-linear / ordered-ring scaffolding already appears, e.g. the even-dimension obstruction
and the dim-2 operator). That base field is, right now, **an INPUT to the cascade, not an OUTPUT
of the fold.** Physics needs the continuum — ℝ with completeness — for anything analytic: real
probabilities (Born), Lie *groups* (not just algebras), Hilbert space, spacetime as a continuum,
real-valued constants. None of that exists yet, and ℝ is neither derived nor (deliberately)
posited — it has merely been computationally stood in.

**The gate.** Before ANY node that requires the continuum / real-valued quantities (the first
such node is likely the first genuinely *physics-recognized* structure in the Emergent layer),
the chain MUST resolve where ℝ comes from. There is exactly ONE permitted outcome:
  **DERIVE the continuum from the fold.** ℝ (and its completeness) must arise as a FORCED
  consequence of the fold's dynamics — the same way the algebras did. The ontology has the engine
  for this: the gather of closures (self-fold missing itself → covering the miss with a closure/
  distortion → the gather of those closures) is the structure from which the continuum is to be
  derived. HOW is the worker's job — do NOT hardcode an approach.

**ℝ IS NOT AN AXIOM AND CANNOT BE ADDED AS ONE.** The foundational stack is fixed: self-look-back,
the miss, the closure/distortion, the gather, the local→global (sheaf-like) failure. ℝ is NOT in
it. Adopting ℝ as a posit is FORBIDDEN — it is the second-axiom smuggling the STANDARD exists to
prevent. There is no human "decision" to add ℝ; there is no option to posit it. The continuum is
DERIVED from the fold — the ONE outcome, never papered over by positing ℝ or by `import
Mathlib...Real`. When the route resists, the status is *route NOT YET found* (reframe through the
trunk / W5 / child a route-finding node) — NEVER "non-derivable" and NEVER an "honest finding" of
failure. The theory generates the continuum; the only live question is how and when we find the
route, never whether it can be reached.

**The drift trap this gate exists to prevent.** A future node silently does
`import Mathlib...Real` and *uses* ℝ to get its result. That smuggles a structure the chain never
derived: the result then descends from `Real` (a Mathlib-given object), not from the fold — a
broken chain. When the chain first needs the continuum, the correct move is to STOP and DERIVE it
from the fold (a dedicated "continuum from the fold" node), NOT to reach for `Real` and NOT to
posit it.

**Status.** UNRESOLVED. No physics/analytic node may be marked ✅ until the continuum is DERIVED.

## N3 — WHAT THE TERMINAL ALGEBRA FORCES: the operator (Clifford) structure  (Algebra, depth 2)
**Target.** Derive the FIRST purely-algebraic structure the terminal algebra `𝕆` forces: the
reorganization of its NON-associative multiplication into an ASSOCIATIVE operator algebra. Prove
that the left-multiplication maps `L_a : x ↦ a·x` of the imaginary terminal algebra satisfy the
quadratic (Clifford) relation `L_a ∘ L_b + L_b ∘ L_a = −bilin(a,b) · id` (equivalently
`L_a² = −Nrm(a)·id` on imaginaries, polarized). This is the algebraic seed of the spinor/gauge
structure physics recognizes — and it is DERIVED from the cascade (the trunk), where the
division-algebra-physics field merely POSITS `𝕆` and reads its Clifford structure off by hand.
**What "done" requires.** A Lean theorem, over the banked terminal algebra (the cascade's `O`,
no new carrier posited), that the imaginary left-multiplication endomorphisms satisfy the
quadratic relation, with the form `bilin`/`Nrm` being the already-banked Born self-overlap (N2),
NOT a freshly posited inner product. Foundations-only, costume that a WRONG sign / the relation
asserted WITHOUT non-associativity (e.g. on an associative base where the squares vanish wrongly)
fails, gate green, STANDARD met.
**Dependency.** N2 (all rungs + the forced stop + the forced iff). The natural route is the
just-closed LEFT SCALING LAW `x·(star x·y) = ι(Nrm x)·y`: on an imaginary `a` (where
`star a = −a`) it reads `a·(a·y) = −Nrm(a)·y`, i.e. `L_a² = −Nrm(a)·id`; polarizing in `a`
gives the Clifford relation. (This is a HINT, not a mandate — the worker derives the HOW.)
**Drift trap.** Do NOT import Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebra`/`QuadraticForm` machinery and ASSERT
that `𝕆`'s operators ARE a Clifford algebra — derive the relation FORWARD from the banked `CD`
product + `star` (the POSIT-vs-DERIVE moat; the SAME drift trap as the forbidden Hurwitz import).
Do NOT posit the bilinear/inner-product form — it is the banked `bilin`/`Nrm`. Do NOT reach for
`ℝ`: stay over the cascade's base ring. **If the honest derivation needs the continuum, STOP and
resolve the ⚠ STANDING DEPENDENCY GATE first — never silently `import Mathlib...Real`.** (N3 as
specified is purely algebraic and should NOT need the continuum; if it fights you toward `ℝ`,
that is the gate, not a workaround.)
**Physics-words-removable.** Delete "Clifford", "spinor", "gauge": the theorem is a pure
statement that the left-multiplication endomorphisms of the terminal algebra satisfy a quadratic
relation governed by the self-overlap form. No physics name may be load-bearing.

## N4 — THE GENERATED OPERATOR ALGEBRA + THE MODULE (SPINOR) STRUCTURE  (Algebra, depth 2)
**Target.** Derive the SECOND purely-algebraic structure the terminal algebra forces, building
directly on N3's Clifford relation. N3 proved each imaginary `Lop a` is (with `clifford_op`) an
anticommuting root of `−bilin`-scalars in the ASSOCIATIVE operator ring `AddMonoid.End (CD (CD B))`.
The forced next structure is the associative subalgebra those operators GENERATE and the fact that
the terminal algebra `𝕆` is itself a MODULE over it (the object physics recognizes as the spinor
module on which the Clifford/operator algebra acts). Concretely, prove: (i) the left-multiplications
by a full basis of imaginaries pairwise anticommute and square to `−Nrm·id` (generalizing N3's
single-pair `units_anticommute` / `L_unit_sq` to the whole imaginary basis — the complete set of
generating relations), and (ii) the unital associative subalgebra of `End` they generate, acting on
`𝕆`, is the operator/Clifford representation, with `𝕆` its module. This is the algebraic seed of the
spinor/gauge structure physics recognizes — DERIVED from the cascade, where the field POSITS the
Clifford module by hand. THE MOAT: posit-vs-derive.
**What "done" requires.** Lean theorems, over the banked octonion shape (no new carrier posited):
the full anticommutation/square relations on an imaginary basis, and the generated-subalgebra +
module statement, with the form the banked `bilin`/`Nrm` (N3) — NOT a freshly posited inner product.
Foundations-only, costume that a WRONG relation (e.g. two distinct basis units that COMMUTE, or a
`+` square) fails, gate green, STANDARD met.
**Dependency.** N3 (the operator/Clifford relation). PURELY ALGEBRAIC — stays over the cascade's
base ring (`ℚ` witnesses); should NOT need the continuum.
**Drift trap.** Derive FORWARD from N3's `Lop`/`clifford_op` + the banked `CD` product/`star`/
`bilin`/`Nrm`. Do NOT import Mathlib's `CliffordAlgebra`/`QuadraticForm` and ASSERT the generated
algebra IS a Clifford algebra / its module IS a spinor module (POSITS the structure — the same drift
trap N3 avoided). Build the generated subalgebra + the module action yourself if Mathlib lacks the
exact shape (RUNBOOK W1: Mathlib absence is not a wall). Do NOT posit the bilinear form (banked
`bilin`/`Nrm`). **If the honest derivation needs the continuum (e.g. it forces a Lie GROUP, a
completion, or a real-spectral argument), STOP and resolve the ⚠ STANDING DEPENDENCY GATE first —
never silently `import Mathlib...Real`.** (N4 as specified is purely algebraic and should NOT need
the continuum; the gate bites at the first physics-recognized/analytic node, likely N5+.)
**Physics-words-removable.** Delete "spinor", "gauge", "Clifford": the theorems are pure statements
that the left-multiplication endomorphisms generate an associative subalgebra with prescribed
anticommutation/square relations governed by the self-overlap form, and that the terminal algebra is
a module over it. No physics name may be load-bearing.

## N5 — THE HERMITIAN JORDAN TOWER AND ITS FORCED CAP AT 3 (Algebra, depth 2)
**Target.** Derive the THIRD purely-algebraic structure the terminal algebra `𝕆` forces, and make
it the first proved instance of the trunk's flagship claim — **ONE CAUSE, MANY TERMINATIONS**. The
SAME octonionic non-associativity that stopped the cascade (banked `not_associative` : `O ℚ` is not
associative) *also* caps a second tower: the Hermitian self-adjoint elements `H_n(𝕆)` under the
symmetrized (Jordan) product `a ∘ b = ½(a·b + b·a)` form a Jordan algebra **iff `n ≤ 3`**. Prove the
cap: (i) for `n = 3`, `H_3(𝕆)` satisfies the Jordan identity — forced because `𝕆` is ALTERNATIVE
(the left/right-alternative law, banked as N3's hypothesis-free `scaling_law`), which is *exactly*
the property `n = 3` needs and no more; (ii) for `n ≥ 4` (concretely `n = 4`), the Jordan identity
FAILS on `H_n(𝕆)` — forced because `n ≥ 4` would require `𝕆` ASSOCIATIVE, and `𝕆` is not
(`not_associative`). The cap value `3` is therefore not posited — it is the exact gap between
"alternative" (which `𝕆` has) and "associative" (which it lost at the cascade stop). The three-fold
structure a physicist recognizes (three of something) appears here for the FIRST time, as a PROVED
algebraic cap, not a named coincidence.
**What "done" requires.** Lean theorems over the banked terminal algebra (`O ℚ` witnesses; no new
carrier posited): the Hermitian matrix carrier and the symmetrized product built from the banked `CD`
product + `star`; a theorem that `H_3(O ℚ)` satisfies the Jordan identity (deriving it from
alternativity / `scaling_law`, NOT asserting it); and a theorem that `H_4(O ℚ)` does NOT (a concrete
Jordan-identity-violating witness whose defect is traced to a non-vanishing associator, i.e. to
`not_associative`). The "one cause" connection (alternativity-not-associativity is the single fact
behind both the cascade stop and the n=3 cap) must be a PROVED link in Lean (e.g. the `n ≥ 4`
obstruction reduces to the same non-associativity witness), never an asserted comment. Foundations-
only, costume that a WRONG cap (e.g. the Jordan identity asserted to hold on `H_4`, or claiming `𝕆`
associative to force a higher cap) FAILS to compile, gate green, STANDARD met.
**Dependency.** N4 (the generated operator algebra + module — the `n = 2` case is essentially the
operator/Clifford/module structure already built) + banked `not_associative` + `scaling_law`
(alternativity) + banked `CD`/`star`. PURELY ALGEBRAIC — stays over the cascade ground ring `ℚ`;
should NOT need the continuum (the cap is a COUNT, not an analytic object).
**Drift trap.** Derive the cap FORWARD: the n=3 Jordan-ness from alternativity, the n≥4 failure from
non-associativity — never POSIT the cap value `3`, never import a Mathlib `JordanAlgebra`/exceptional-
algebra structure and ASSERT `H_3(𝕆)` IS the Albert algebra (the SAME posit-vs-derive drift trap N3/N4
avoided). If Mathlib lacks the Hermitian-matrix-over-a-non-associative-algebra carrier or the Jordan
identity machinery, BUILD it (W1: Mathlib absence is not a wall) — note `O ℚ` has NO `Ring` instance,
so Mathlib's `Matrix` ring API does not apply directly; the Hermitian carrier + symmetrized product
must be built at the non-associative level. Do NOT reach for `ℝ`: the cap is purely algebraic.
**★ If the honest derivation forces a Lie GROUP / a completion / a real-spectral / eigenvalue
argument (e.g. you find yourself wanting `H_3(𝕆)`'s automorphism GROUP `F₄`, or real eigenvalues),
STOP and resolve the ⚠ STANDING DEPENDENCY GATE first — never silently `import Mathlib...Real`.**
(The cap itself is a polynomial-identity fact and should NOT need the continuum; the gate bites only
if you drift toward the automorphism GROUP, which is a later node.)
**THE ONE LAW (W5).** If the Jordan identity on `H_3` fights you, return to the trunk: the identity
holds *because* `𝕆` is alternative — `scaling_law` is the left-alternative law, banked and hypothesis-
free. If the `n ≥ 4` failure fights you, return to the trunk: it fails *because* `𝕆` is non-
associative — `not_associative` is banked. Do NOT add a hypothesis; do NOT weaken to `H_2`. If a hard
sub-lemma still fights after the theory-native reframe → DECOMPOSE (W3): bank the cap direction that
compiles foundations-only + a costume that bites, child the remainder onto the chain tail, complete
as "decomposed."
**Physics-words-removable.** Delete "generation", "Jordan-as-physics", any physical name: the
theorems are pure statements that the symmetrized product on the Hermitian elements of the terminal
algebra satisfies the Jordan identity exactly when the matrix order is ≤ 3, the cap being forced by
the algebra's alternativity-without-associativity. No physics name may be load-bearing.

## N6 onward — TO BE SPECIFIED AFTER N5 LANDS
The downstream nodes (the physics-recognized structures that emerge — gauge content, mixing,
spacetime signature) will be specified as targets ONLY after N5 lands and the ⚠ STANDING DEPENDENCY
GATE (the continuum) is resolved — the first genuinely physics-recognized / analytic node is where
the gate bites (gauge groups are Lie GROUPS, which need the continuum; automorphism groups of the
Jordan/operator structures are the natural place it first bites). Specifying them now would risk
hardcoding a path the derivation hasn't earned.

**Why we stop the spec here:** a roadmap that dictates the full derivation in advance is a
hardcoded solution. The agent earns each node, and the next target is specified against what
the chain actually produced — not against what we guessed it would. The fold is the start of
all physics; we let it unfold and specify the next target from the ground it actually creates.
